Deal with the remote steam being discovered and how to render\n\t     that to the local interface.\n\t\n\t  ## Reference\n\t\n\t**/\n\t\n\tvar gen = __webpack_require__(336);\n\t\n\t// export detect\n\tvar detect = exports.detect = __webpack_require__(144);\n\tvar findPlugin = __webpack_require__(83);\n\t\n\t// export cog logger for convenience\n\texports.logger = __webpack_require__(30);\n\t\n\t// export peer connection\n\tvar RTCPeerConnection =\n\texports.RTCPeerConnection = detect('RTCPeerConnection');\n\t\n\t// add the couple utility\n\texports.couple = __webpack_require__(335);\n\t\n\t/**\n\t  ### createConnection\n\t\n\t  ```\n\t  createConnection(opts?, constraints?) => RTCPeerConnection\n\t  ```\n\t\n\t  Create a new `RTCPeerConnection` auto generating default opts as required.\n\t\n\t  ```js\n\t  var conn;\n\t\n\t  // this is ok\n\t  conn = rtc.createConnection();\n\t\n\t  // and so is this\n\t  conn = rtc.createConnection({\n\t    iceServers: []\n\t  });\n\t  ```\n\t**/\n\texports.createConnection = function(opts, constraints) {\n\t  var plugin = findPlugin((opts || {}).plugins);\n\t  var PeerConnection = (opts || {}).RTCPeerConnection || RTCPeerConnection;\n\t\n\t  // generate the config based on options provided\n\t  var config = gen.config(opts);\n\t\n\t  // generate appropriate connection constraints\n\t  constraints = gen.connectionConstraints(opts, constraints);\n\t\n\t  if (plugin && typeof plugin.createConnection == 'function') {\n\t    return plugin.createConnection(config, constraints);\n\t  }\n\t\n\t  return new PeerConnection(config, constraints);\n\t};\n\n\n/***/ },\n/* 85 */\n/***/ function(module, exports) {\n\n\t/**\n\t  ## pluck\n\t\n\t  Extract targeted properties from a source object.

When no additional data is supplied to\n\t    this function then only the id of the signaller is sent to all active\n\t    members of the messenging network.\n\t\n\t    #### Joining Rooms\n\t\n\t    To join a room using an announce call you simply provide the name of the\n\t    room you wish to join as part of the data block that you annouce, for\n\t    example:\n\t\n\t    ```js\n\t    signaller.announce({ room: 'testroom' });\n\t    ```\n\t\n\t    Signalling servers (such as\n\t    [rtc-switchboard](https://github.com/rtc-io/rtc-switchboard)) will then\n\t    place your peer connection into a room with other peers that have also\n\t    announced in this room.\n\t\n\t    Once you have joined a room, the server will only deliver messages that\n\t    you `send` to other peers within that room.\n\t\n\t    #### Providing Additional Announce Data\n\t\n\t    There may be instances where you wish to send additional data as part of\n\t    your announce message in your application.  For instance, maybe you want\n\t    to send an alias or nick as part of your announce message rather than just\n\t    use the signaller's generated id.\n\t\n\t    If for instance you were writing a simple chat application you could join\n\t    the `webrtc` room and tell everyone your name with the following announce\n\t    call:\n\t\n\t    ```js\n\t    signaller.announce({\n\t      room: 'webrtc',\n\t      nick: 'Damon'\n\t    });\n\t    ```\n\t\n\t    #### Announcing Updates\n\t\n\t    The signaller is written to distinguish between initial peer announcements\n\t    and peer data updates (see the docs on the announce handler below). As\n\t    such it is ok to provide any data updates using the announce method also.\n\t\n\t    For instance, I could send a status update as an announce message to flag\n\t    that I am going offline:\n\t\n\t    ```js\n\t    signaller.announce({ status: 'offline' });\n\t    ```\n\t\n\t  **/\n\t  signaller.announce = function(data) {\n\t    announced = true;\n\t    signaller._update(data);\n\t    clearTimeout(announceTimer);\n\t\n\t    // send the attributes over the network\n\t    return announceTimer = setTimeout(signaller._announce, (opts || {}).announceDelay || 10);\n\t  };\n\t\n\t  /**\n\t    ### leave()\n\t\n\t    Tell the signalling server we are leaving.  Calling this function is\n\t    usually not required though as the signalling server should issue correct\n\t    `/leave` messages when it detects a disconnect event.\n\t\n\t  **/\n\t  signaller.leave = signaller.close = function() {\n\t    // send the leave signal\n\t    signaller.send('/leave', { id: signaller.id });\n\t\n\t    // stop announcing on reconnect\n\t    signaller.removeListener('disconnected', handleDisconnect);\n\t    signaller.removeListener('connected', signaller._announce);\n\t\n\t    // end our current queue\n\t    queue.end();\n\t\n\t    // set connected to false\n\t    readyState = RS_DISCONNECTED;\n\t  };\n\t\n\t  // update the signaller agent\n\t  signaller._update({ agent: 'signaller@' + metadata.version });\n\t\n\t  // autoconnect\n\t

For example:\n\t\n\t  Example:\n\t\n\t  ```javascript\n\t  let promise1 = resolve(1);\n\t  let promise2 = reject(new Error(\"2\"));\n\t  let promise3 = reject(new Error(\"3\"));\n\t  let promises = [ promise1, promise2, promise3 ];\n\t\n\t  Promise.all(promises).then(function(array){\n\t    // Code here never runs because there are rejected promises!\n\t  }, function(error) {\n\t    // error.message === \"2\"\n\t  });\n\t  ```\n\t\n\t  @method all\n\t  @static\n\t  @param {Array} entries array of promises\n\t  @param {String} label optional string for labeling the promise.\n\t  Useful for tooling.\n\t  @return {Promise} promise that is fulfilled when all `promises` have been\n\t  fulfilled, or rejected if any of them become rejected.\n\t  @static\n\t*/\n\tfunction all(entries) {\n\t  return new Enumerator(this, entries).promise;\n\t}\n\t\n\t/**\n\t  `Promise.race` returns a new promise which is settled in the same way as the\n\t  first passed promise to settle.\n\t\n\t  Example:\n\t\n\t  ```javascript\n\t  let promise1 = new Promise(function(resolve, reject){\n\t    setTimeout(function(){\n\t      resolve('promise 1');\n\t    }, 200);\n\t  });\n\t\n\t  let promise2 = new Promise(function(resolve, reject){\n\t    setTimeout(function(){\n\t      resolve('promise 2');\n\t    }, 100);\n\t  });\n\t\n\t  Promise.race([promise1, promise2]).then(function(result){\n\t    // result === 'promise 2' because it was resolved before promise1\n\t    // was resolved.\n\t  });\n\t  ```\n\t\n\t  `Promise.race` is deterministic in that only the state of the first\n\t  settled promise matters. For example, even if other promises given to the\n\t  `promises` array argument are resolved, but the first settled promise has\n\t  become rejected before the other promises became fulfilled, the returned\n\t  promise will become rejected:\n\t\n\t  ```javascript\n\t  let promise1 = new Promise(function(resolve, reject){\n\t    setTimeout(function(){\n\t      resolve('promise 1');\n\t    }, 200);\n\t  });\n\t\n\t  let promise2 = new Promise(function(resolve, reject){\n\t    setTimeout(function(){\n\t      reject(new Error('promise 2'));\n\t    }, 100);\n\t  });\n\t\n\t  Promise.race([promise1, promise2]).then(function(result){\n\t    // Code here never runs\n\t  }, function(reason){\n\t    // reason.message === 'promise 2' because promise 2 became rejected before\n\t    // promise 1 became fulfilled\n\t  });\n\t  ```\n\t\n\t  An example real-world use case is implementing timeouts:\n\t\n\t  ```javascript\n\t  Promise.race([ajax('foo.json'), timeout(5000)])\n\t  ```\n\t\n\t  @method race\n\t  @static\n\t  @param {Array} promises array of promises to observe\n\t  Useful for tooling.\n\t  @return {Promise} a promise which settles in the same way as the first passed\n\t  promise to settle.\n\t*/\n\tfunction race(entries) {\n\t  /*jshint validthis:true */\n\t  var Constructor = this;\n\t\n\t  if (!isArray(entries)) {\n\t    return new Constructor(function (_, reject) {\n\t      return reject(new TypeError('You must pass an array to race.'));\n\t    });\n\t  } else {\n\t    return new Constructor(function (resolve, reject) {\n\t      var length = entries.length;\n\t      for (var i = 0; i < length; i++) {\n\t        Constructor.resolve(entries[i]).then(resolve, reject);\n\t      }\n\t    });\n\t  }\n\t}\n\t\n\t/**\n\t  `Promise.reject` returns a promise rejected with the passed `reason`.\n\t  It is shorthand for the following:\n\t\n\t  ```javascript\n\t  let promise = new Promise(function(resolve, reject){\n\t    reject(new Error('WHOOPS'));\n\t  });\n\t\n\t  promise.then(function(value){\n\t    // Code here doesn't run because the promise is rejected!\n\t  }, function(reason){\n\t    // reason.message === 'WHOOPS'\n\t  });\n\t  ```\n\t\n\t  Instead of writing the above, your code now simply becomes the following:\n\t\n\t  ```javascript\n\t  let promise = Promise.reject(new Error('WHOOPS'));\n\t\n\t  promise.then(function(value){\n\t    // Code here doesn't run because the promise is rejected!\n\t  }, function(reason){\n\t    // reason.message === 'WHOOPS'\n\t  });\n\t  ```\n\t\n\t  @method reject\n\t  @static\n\t  @param {Any} reason value that the returned promise will be rejected with.\n\t  Useful for tooling.\n\t  @return {Promise} a promise rejected with the given `reason`.\n\t*/\n\tfunction reject(reason) {\n\t  /*jshint validthis:true */\n\t  var Constructor = this;\n\t  var promise = new Constructor(noop);\n\t  _reject(promise, reason);\n\t  return promise;\n\t}\n\t\n\tfunction needsResolver() {\n\t  throw new TypeError('You must pass a resolver function as the first argument to the promise constructor');\n\t}\n\t\n\tfunction needsNew() {\n\t  throw new TypeError(\"Failed to construct 'Promise': Please use the 'new' operator, this object constructor cannot be called as a function.\");\n\t}\n\t\n\t/**\n\t  Promise objects represent the eventual result of an asynchronous operation. The\n\t  primary way of interacting with a promise is through its `then` method, which\n\t  registers callbacks to receive either a promise's eventual value or the reason\n\t  why the promise cannot be fulfilled.\n\t\n\t  Terminology\n\t  -----------\n\t\n\t  - `promise` is an object or function with a `then` method whose behavior conforms to this specification.\n\t  - `thenable` is an object or function that defines a `then` method.\n\t  - `value` is any legal JavaScript value (including undefined, a thenable, or a promise).\n\t  - `exception` is a value that is thrown using the throw statement.\n\t  - `reason` is a value that indicates why a promise was rejected.\n\t  - `settled` the final resting state of a promise, fulfilled or rejected.\n\t\n\t  A promise can be in one of three states: pending, fulfilled, or rejected.\n\t\n\t  Promises that are fulfilled have a fulfillment value and are in the fulfilled\n\t  state.  Promises that are rejected have a rejection reason and are in the\n\t  rejected state.  A fulfillment value is never a thenable.\n\t\n\t  Promises can also be said to *resolve* a value.  If this value is also a\n\t  promise, then the original promise's settled state will match the value's\n\t  settled state.  So a promise that *resolves* a promise that rejects will\n\t  itself reject, and a promise that *resolves* a promise that fulfills will\n\t  itself fulfill.\n\t\n\t\n\t  Basic Usage:\n\t  ------------\n\t\n\t  ```js\n\t  let promise = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {\n\t    // on success\n\t    resolve(value);\n\t\n\t    // on failure\n\t    reject(reason);\n\t  });\n\t\n\t  promise.then(function(value) {\n\t    // on fulfillment\n\t  }, function(reason) {\n\t    // on rejection\n\t  });\n\t  ```\n\t\n\t  Advanced Usage:\n\t  ---------------\n\t\n\t  Promises shine when abstracting away asynchronous interactions such as\n\t  `XMLHttpRequest`s.\n\t\n\t  ```js\n\t  function getJSON(url) {\n\t    return new Promise(function(resolve, reject){\n\t      let xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();\n\t\n\t      xhr.open('GET', url);\n\t      xhr.onreadystatechange = handler;\n\t      xhr.responseType = 'json';\n\t      xhr.setRequestHeader('Accept', 'application/json');\n\t      xhr.send();\n\t\n\t      function handler() {\n\t        if (this.readyState === this.DONE) {\n\t          if (this.status === 200) {\n\t            resolve(this.response);\n\t          } else {\n\t            reject(new Error('getJSON: `' + url + '` failed with status: [' + this.status + ']'));\n\t          }\n\t        }\n\t      };\n\t    });\n\t  }\n\t\n\t  getJSON('/posts.json').then(function(json) {\n\t    // on fulfillment\n\t  }, function(reason) {\n\t    // on rejection\n\t  });\n\t  ```\n\t\n\t  Unlike callbacks, promises are great composable primitives.\n\t\n\t  ```js\n\t  Promise.all([\n\t    getJSON('/posts'),\n\t    getJSON('/comments')\n\t  ]).then(function(values){\n\t    values[0] // => postsJSON\n\t    values[1] // => commentsJSON\n\t\n\t    return values;\n\t  });\n\t  ```\n\t\n\t  @class Promise\n\t  @param {function} resolver\n\t  Useful for tooling.\n\t  @constructor\n\t*/\n\tfunction Promise(resolver) {\n\t  this[PROMISE_ID] = nextId();\n\t  this._result = this._state = undefined;\n\t  this._subscribers = [];\n\t\n\t  if (noop !== resolver) {\n\t    typeof resolver !== 'function' && needsResolver();\n\t    this instanceof Promise ? initializePromise(this, resolver) : needsNew();\n\t  }\n\t}\n\t\n\tPromise.all = all;\n\tPromise.race = race;\n\tPromise.resolve = resolve;\n\tPromise.reject = reject;\n\tPromise._setScheduler = setScheduler;\n\tPromise._setAsap = setAsap;\n\tPromise._asap = asap;\n\t\n\tPromise.prototype = {\n\t  constructor: Promise,\n\t\n\t  /**\n\t    The primary way of interacting with a promise is through its `then` method,\n\t    which registers callbacks to receive either a promise's eventual value or the\n\t    reason why the promise cannot be fulfilled.\n\t  \n\t    ```js\n\t    findUser().then(function(user){\n\t      // user is available\n\t    }, function(reason){\n\t      // user is unavailable, and you are given the reason why\n\t    });\n\t    ```\n\t  \n\t    Chaining\n\t    --------\n\t  \n\t    The return value of `then` is itself a promise.  This second, 'downstream'\n\t    promise is resolved with the return value of the first promise's fulfillment\n\t    or rejection handler, or rejected if the handler throws an exception.\n\t  \n\t    ```js\n\t    findUser().then(function (user) {\n\t      return user.name;\n\t    }, function (reason) {\n\t      return 'default name';\n\t    }).then(function (userName) {\n\t      // If `findUser` fulfilled, `userName` will be the user's name, otherwise it\n\t      // will be `'default name'`\n\t    });\n\t  \n\t    findUser().then(function (user) {\n\t      throw new Error('Found user, but still unhappy');\n\t    }, function (reason) {\n\t      throw new Error('`findUser` rejected and we're unhappy');\n\t    }).then(function (value) {\n\t      // never reached\n\t    }, function (reason) {\n\t      // if `findUser` fulfilled, `reason` will be 'Found user, but still unhappy'.\n\t      // If `findUser` rejected, `reason` will be '`findUser` rejected and we're unhappy'.\n\t    });\n\t    ```\n\t    If the downstream promise does not specify a rejection handler, rejection reasons will be propagated further downstream.\n\t  \n\t    ```js\n\t    findUser().then(function (user) {\n\t      throw new PedagogicalException('Upstream error');\n\t    }).then(function (value) {\n\t      // never reached\n\t    }).then(function (value) {\n\t      // never reached\n\t    }, function (reason) {\n\t      // The `PedgagocialException` is propagated all the way down to here\n\t    });\n\t    ```\n\t  \n\t    Assimilation\n\t    ------------\n\t  \n\t    Sometimes the value you want to propagate to a downstream promise can only be\n\t    retrieved asynchronously. This can be achieved by returning a promise in the\n\t    fulfillment or rejection handler. The downstream promise will then be pending\n\t    until the returned promise is settled. This is called *assimilation*.\n\t  \n\t    ```js\n\t    findUser().then(function (user) {\n\t      return findCommentsByAuthor(user);\n\t    }).then(function (comments) {\n\t      // The user's comments are now available\n\t    });\n\t    ```\n\t  \n\t    If the assimliated promise rejects, then the downstream promise will also reject.\n\t  \n\t    ```js\n\t    findUser().then(function (user) {\n\t      return findCommentsByAuthor(user);\n\t    }).then(function (comments) {\n\t      // If `findCommentsByAuthor` fulfills, we'll have the value here\n\t    }, function (reason) {\n\t      // If `findCommentsByAuthor` rejects, we'll have the reason here\n\t    });\n\t    ```\n\t  \n\t    Simple Example\n\t    --------------\n\t  \n\t    Synchronous Example\n\t  \n\t    ```javascript\n\t    let result;\n\t  \n\t    try {\n\t      result = findResult();\n\t      // success\n\t    } catch(reason) {\n\t      // failure\n\t    }\n\t    ```\n\t  \n\t    Errback Example\n\t  \n\t    ```js\n\t    findResult(function(result, err){\n\t      if (err) {\n\t        // failure\n\t      } else {\n\t        // success\n\t      }\n\t    });\n\t    ```\n\t  \n\t    Promise Example;\n\t  \n\t    ```javascript\n\t    findResult().then(function(result){\n\t      // success\n\t    }, function(reason){\n\t      // failure\n\t    });\n\t    ```\n\t  \n\t    Advanced Example\n\t    --------------\n\t  \n\t    Synchronous Example\n\t  \n\t    ```javascript\n\t    let author, books;\n\t  \n\t    try {\n\t      author = findAuthor();\n\t      books  = findBooksByAuthor(author);\n\t      // success\n\t    } catch(reason) {\n\t      // failure\n\t    }\n\t    ```\n\t  \n\t    Errback Example\n\t  \n\t    ```js\n\t  \n\t    function foundBooks(books) {\n\t  \n\t    }\n\t  \n\t    function failure(reason) {\n\t  \n\t    }\n\t  \n\t    findAuthor(function(author, err){\n\t      if (err) {\n\t        failure(err);\n\t        // failure\n\t      } else {\n\t        try {\n\t          findBoooksByAuthor(author, function(books, err) {\n\t            if (err) {\n\t              failure(err);\n\t            } else {\n\t              try {\n\t                foundBooks(books);\n\t              } catch(reason) {\n\t                failure(reason);\n\t              }\n\t            }\n\t          });\n\t        } catch(error) {\n\t          failure(err);\n\t        }\n\t        // success\n\t      }\n\t    });\n\t    ```\n\t  \n\t    Promise Example;\n\t  \n\t    ```javascript\n\t    findAuthor().\n\t      then(findBooksByAuthor).\n\t      then(function(books){\n\t        // found books\n\t    }).catch(function(reason){\n\t      // something went wrong\n\t    });\n\t    ```\n\t  \n\t    @method then\n\t    @param {Function} onFulfilled\n\t    @param {Function} onRejected\n\t    Useful for tooling.\n\t    @return {Promise}\n\t  */\n\t  then: then,\n\t\n\t  /**\n\t    `catch` is simply sugar for `then(undefined, onRejection)` which makes it the same\n\t    as the catch block of a try/catch statement.\n\t  \n\t    ```js\n\t    function findAuthor(){\n\t      throw new Error('couldn't find that author');\n\t    }\n\t  \n\t    // synchronous\n\t    try {\n\t      findAuthor();\n\t    } catch(reason) {\n\t      // something went wrong\n\t    }\n\t  \n\t    // async with promises\n\t    findAuthor().catch(function(reason){\n\t      // something went wrong\n\t    });\n\t    ```\n\t  \n\t    @method catch\n\t    @param {Function} onRejection\n\t    Useful for tooling.\n\t    @return {Promise}\n\t  */\n\t  'catch': function _catch(onRejection) {\n\t    return this.then(null, onRejection);\n\t  }\n\t};\n\t\n\tfunction polyfill() {\n\t    var local = undefined;\n\t\n\t    if (typeof global !== 'undefined') {\n\t        local = global;\n\t    } else if (typeof self !== 'undefined') {\n\t        local = self;\n\t    } else {\n\t        try {\n\t            local = Function('return this')();\n\t        } catch (e) {\n\t            throw new Error('polyfill failed because global object is unavailable in this environment');\n\t        }\n\t    }\n\t\n\t    var P = local.Promise;\n\t\n\t    if (P) {\n\t        var promiseToString = null;\n\t        try {\n\t            promiseToString = Object.prototype.toString.call(P.resolve());\n\t        } catch (e) {\n\t            // silently ignored\n\t        }\n\t\n\t        if (promiseToString === '[object Promise]' && !P.cast) {\n\t            return;\n\t        }\n\t    }\n\t\n\t    local.Promise = Promise;\n\t}\n\t\n\tpolyfill();\n\t// Strange compat..\n\tPromise.polyfill = polyfill;\n\tPromise.Promise = Promise;\n\t\n\treturn Promise;\n\t\n\t})));\n\t//# sourceMappingURL=es6-promise.map\n\t/* WEBPACK VAR INJECTION */}.call(exports, __webpack_require__(6), (function() { return this;

For your\n\t  testing and development you are more than welcome to use this also, but\n\t  just be aware that we use this for our testing so it may go up and down\n\t  a little.  If you need something more stable, why not consider deploying\n\t  an instance of the switchboard yourself - it's pretty easy :)\n\t\n\t  ## Reference\n\t\n\t  ```\n\t  quickconnect(signalhost, opts?) => rtc-sigaller instance (+ helpers)\n\t  ```\n\t\n\t  ### Valid Quick Connect Options\n\t\n\t  The options provided to the `rtc-quickconnect` module function influence the\n\t  behaviour of some of the underlying components used from the rtc.io suite.\n\t\n\t  Listed below are some of the commonly used options:\n\t\n\t  - `ns` (default: '')\n\t\n\t    An optional namespace for your signalling room.  While quickconnect\n\t    will generate a unique hash for the room, this can be made to be more\n\t    unique by providing a namespace.  Using a namespace means two demos\n\t    that have generated the same hash but use a different namespace will be\n\t    in different rooms.\n\t\n\t  - `room` (default: null) _added 0.6_\n\t\n\t    Rather than use the internal hash generation\n\t    (plus optional namespace) for room name generation, simply use this room\n\t    name instead.  __NOTE:__ Use of the `room` option takes precendence over\n\t    `ns`.\n\t\n\t  - `debug` (default: false)\n\t\n\t  Write rtc.io suite debug output to the browser console.\n\t\n\t  - `expectedLocalStreams` (default: not specified) _added 3.0_\n\t\n\t    By providing a positive integer value for this option will mean that\n\t    the created quickconnect instance will wait until the specified number of\n\t    streams have been added to the quickconnect \"template\" before announcing\n\t    to the signaling server.\n\t\n\t  - `manualJoin` (default: `false`)\n\t\n\t    Set this value to `true` if you would prefer to call the `join` function\n\t    to connecting to the signalling server, rather than having that happen\n\t    automatically as soon as quickconnect is ready to.\n\t\n\t  #### Options for Peer Connection Creation\n\t\n\t  Options that are passed onto the\n\t  [rtc.createConnection](https://github.com/rtc-io/rtc#createconnectionopts-constraints)\n\t  function:\n\t\n\t  - `iceServers`\n\t\n\t  This provides a list of ice servers that can be used to help negotiate a\n\t  connection between peers.\n\t\n\t  #### Options for P2P negotiation\n\t\n\t  Under the hood, quickconnect uses the\n\t  [rtc/couple](https://github.com/rtc-io/rtc#rtccouple) logic, and the options\n\t  passed to quickconnect are also passed onto this function.\n\t\n\t**/\n\tmodule.exports = function(signalhost, opts) {\n\t  var hash = typeof location != 'undefined' && location.hash.slice(1);\n\t  var signaller = __webpack_require__(323)(extend({\n\t    signaller: signalhost,\n\t\n\t    // use the primus endpoint as a fallback in case we are talking to an\n\t    // older switchboard instance\n\t    endpoints: ['/', '/primus']\n\t  }, opts));\n\t\n\t  var getPeerData = __webpack_require__(139)(signaller.peers);\n\t  var generateIceServers = __webpack_require__(322);\n\t\n\t  // init configurable vars\n\t  var ns = (opts || {}).ns || '';\n\t  var room = (opts || {}).room;\n\t  var debugging = (opts || {}).debug;\n\t  var allowJoin = !(opts || {}).manualJoin;\n\t  var profile = {};\n\t  var announced = false;\n\t\n\t  // Schemes allow customisation about how connections are made\n\t  // In particular, providing schemes allows providing different sets of ICE servers\n\t  // between peers\n\t  var schemes = __webpack_require__(327)(signaller, opts);\n\t\n\t  // collect the local streams\n\t  var localStreams = [];\n\t\n\t  // create the calls map\n\t  var calls = signaller.calls = __webpack_require__(325)(signaller, opts);\n\t\n\t  // create the known data channels registry\n\t  var channels = {};\n\t  var pending = {};\n\t  // Reconnecting indicates peers that are in the process of reconnecting\n\t  var reconnecting = {};\n\t\n\t  // save the plugins passed to the signaller\n\t  var plugins = signaller.plugins = (opts || {}).plugins || [];\n\t  var plugin = detectPlugin(plugins);\n\t  var pluginReady;\n\t\n\t  // check how many local streams have been expected (default: 0)\n\t  var expectedLocalStreams = parseInt((opts || {}).expectedLocalStreams, 10) || 0;\n\t  var announceTimer = 0;\n\t  var updateTimer = 0;\n\t\n\t  function checkReadyToAnnounce() {\n\t    clearTimeout(announceTimer);\n\t    // if we have already announced do nothing!\n\t    if (announced) {\n\t      return;\n\t    }\n\t\n\t    if (!

identified by\n\t  `targetId` via the signaller.\n\t\n\t  The following options can be provided in the `opts` argument:\n\t\n\t  - `sdpfilter` (default: null)\n\t\n\t    A simple function for filtering SDP as part of the peer\n\t    connection handshake (see the Using Filters details below).\n\t\n\t  ##### Example Usage\n\t\n\t  ```js\n\t  var couple = require('rtc/couple');\n\t\n\t  couple(pc, '54879965-ce43-426e-a8ef-09ac1e39a16d', signaller);\n\t  ```\n\t\n\t  ##### Using Filters\n\t\n\t  In certain instances you may wish to modify the raw SDP that is provided\n\t  by the `createOffer` and `createAnswer` calls.  This can be done by passing\n\t  a `sdpfilter` function (or array) in the options.  For example:\n\t\n\t  ```js\n\t  // run the sdp from through a local tweakSdp function.\n\t  couple(pc, '54879965-ce43-426e-a8ef-09ac1e39a16d', signaller, {\n\t    sdpfilter: tweakSdp\n\t  });\n\t  ```\n\t\n\t**/\n\tfunction couple(pc, targetId, signaller, opts) {\n\t  var debugLabel = (opts || {}).debugLabel || 'rtc';\n\t  var debug = __webpack_require__(30)(debugLabel + '/couple');\n\t\n\t  // create a monitor for the connection\n\t  var mon = monitor(pc, targetId, signaller, (opts || {}).logger);\n\t  var emit = mbus('', mon);\n\t  var reactive = (opts || {}).reactive;\n\t  var endOfCandidates = true;\n\t\n\t  // configure the time to wait between receiving a 'disconnect'\n\t  // iceConnectionState and determining that we are closed\n\t  var disconnectTimeout = (opts || {}).disconnectTimeout || 10000;\n\t  var disconnectTimer;\n\t\n\t  // Target ready indicates that the target peer has indicated it is\n\t  // ready to begin coupling\n\t  var targetReady = false;\n\t  var targetInfo = undefined;\n\t  var readyInterval = (opts || {}).readyInterval || 100;\n\t  var readyTimer;\n\t\n\t  // Failure timeout\n\t  var failTimeout = (opts || {}).failTimeout || 30000;\n\t  var failTimer;\n\t\n\t  // Request offer timer\n\t  var requestOfferTimer;\n\t\n\t  // Interoperability flags\n\t  var allowReactiveInterop = (opts || {}).allowReactiveInterop;\n\t\n\t  // initilaise the negotiation helpers\n\t  var isMaster = signaller.isMaster(targetId);\n\t\n\t  // initialise the processing queue (one at a time please)\n\t  var q = queue(pc, opts);\n\t  var coupling = false;\n\t  var negotiationRequired = false;\n\t  var renegotiateRequired = false;\n\t  var creatingOffer = false;\n\t  var interoperating = false;\n\t\n\t  /**\n\t    Indicates whether this peer connection is in a state where it is able to have new offers created\n\t   **/\n\t  function isReadyForOffer() {\n\t    return !coupling && pc.signalingState === 'stable';\n\t  }\n\t\n\t  function createOffer() {\n\t    // If coupling is already in progress, return\n\t    if (!isReadyForOffer()) return;\n\t\n\t    debug('[' + signaller.id + '] ' + 'Creating new offer for connection to ' + targetId);\n\t    // Otherwise, create the offer\n\t    coupling = true;\n\t    creatingOffer = true;\n\t    negotiationRequired = false;\n\t    q.createOffer().then(function() {\n\t      creatingOffer = false;\n\t    }).catch(function() {\n\t      creatingOffer = false;\n\t    });\n\t  }\n\t\n\t  var createOrRequestOffer = throttle(function() {\n\t    if (!targetReady) {\n\t      debug('[' + signaller.id + '] ' + targetId + ' not yet ready for offer');\n\t      return emit.once('target.ready', createOrRequestOffer);\n\t    }\n\t\n\t    // If this is not the master, always send the negotiate request\n\t    // Redundant requests are eliminated on the master side\n\t    if (! isMaster) {\n\t      debug('[' + signaller.id + '] ' + 'Requesting negotiation from ' + targetId + ' (requesting offerer?

Sometimes it's called a \"filter\",\n\t// but that's not a great name for it, since that implies a thing where\n\t// some bits pass through, and others are simply ignored.  (That would\n\t// be a valid example of a transform, of course.)\n\t//\n\t// While the output is causally related to the input, it's not a\n\t// necessarily symmetric or synchronous transformation.  For example,\n\t// a zlib stream might take multiple plain-text writes(), and then\n\t// emit a single compressed chunk some time in the future.\n\t//\n\t// Here's how this works:\n\t//\n\t// The Transform stream has all the aspects of the readable and writable\n\t// stream classes.  When you write(chunk), that calls _write(chunk,cb)\n\t// internally, and returns false if there's a lot of pending writes\n\t// buffered up.  When you call read(), that calls _read(n) until\n\t// there's enough pending readable data buffered up.\n\t//\n\t// In a transform stream, the written data is placed in a buffer.  When\n\t// _read(n) is called, it transforms the queued up data, calling the\n\t// buffered _write cb's as it consumes chunks.  If consuming a single\n\t// written chunk would result in multiple output chunks, then the first\n\t// outputted bit calls the readcb, and subsequent chunks just go into\n\t// the read buffer, and will cause it to emit 'readable' if necessary.\n\t//\n\t// This way, back-pressure is actually determined by the reading side,\n\t// since _read has to be called to start processing a new chunk.  However,\n\t// a pathological inflate type of transform can cause excessive buffering\n\t// here.  For example, imagine a stream where every byte of input is\n\t// interpreted as an integer from 0-255, and then results in that many\n\t// bytes of output.  Writing the 4 bytes {ff,ff,ff,ff} would result in\n\t// 1kb of data being output.  In this case, you could write a very small\n\t// amount of input, and end up with a very large amount of output.  In\n\t// such a pathological inflating mechanism, there'd be no way to tell\n\t// the system to stop doing the transform.  A single 4MB write could\n\t// cause the system to run out of memory.\n\t//\n\t// However, even in such a pathological case, only a single written chunk\n\t// would be consumed, and then the rest would wait (un-transformed) until\n\t// the results of the previous transformed chunk were consumed.\n\t\n\tmodule.exports = Transform;\n\t\n\tvar Duplex = __webpack_require__(__webpack_module_template_argument_0__);\n\t\n\t/*<replacement>*/\n\tvar util = __webpack_require__(15);\n\tutil.inherits = __webpack_require__(11);\n\t/*</replacement>*/\n\t\n\tutil.inherits(Transform, Duplex);\n\t\n\t\n\tfunction TransformState(options, stream) {\n\t  this.afterTransform = function(er, data) {\n\t    return afterTransform(stream, er, data);\n\t  };\n\t\n\t  this.needTransform = false;\n\t  this.transforming = false;\n\t  this.writecb = null;\n\t  this.writechunk = null;\n\t}\n\t\n\tfunction afterTransform(stream, er, data) {\n\t  var ts = stream._transformState;\n\t  ts.transforming = false;\n\t\n\t  var cb = ts.writecb;\n\t\n\t  if (!cb)\n\t    return stream.emit('error', new Error('no writecb in Transform class'));\n\t\n\t  ts.writechunk = null;\n\t  ts.writecb = null;\n\t\n\t  if (!util.isNullOrUndefined(data))\n\t    stream.push(data);\n\t\n\t  if (cb)\n\t    cb(er);\n\t\n\t  var rs = stream._readableState;\n\t  rs.reading = false;\n\t  if (rs.needReadable || rs.length < rs.highWaterMark) {\n\t    stream._read(rs.highWaterMark);\n\t  }\n\t}\n\t\n\t\n\tfunction Transform(options) {\n\t  if (!(this instanceof Transform))\n\t    return new Transform(options);\n\t\n\t  Duplex.call(this, options);\n\t\n\t  this._transformState = new TransformState(options, this);\n\t\n\t  // when the writable side finishes, then flush out anything remaining.\n\t  var stream = this;\n\t\n\t  // start out asking for a readable event once data is transformed.\n\t  this._readableState.needReadable = true;\n\t\n\t  // we have implemented the _read method, and done the other things\n\t  // that Readable wants before the first _read call, so unset the\n\t  // sync guard flag.\n\t  this._readableState.sync = false;\n\t\n\t  this.once('prefinish', function() {\n\t    if (util.isFunction(this._flush))\n\t      this._flush(function(er) {\n\t        done(stream, er);\n\t      });\n\t    else\n\t      done(stream);\n\t  });\n\t}\n\t\n\tTransform.prototype.push = function(chunk, encoding) {\n\t  this._transformState.needTransform = false;\n\t  return Duplex.prototype.push.call(this, chunk, encoding);\n\t};\n\t\n\t// This is the part where you do stuff!\n\t// override this function in implementation classes.\n\t// 'chunk' is an input chunk.\n\t//\n\t// Call `push(newChunk)` to pass along transformed output\n\t// to the readable side.

For instance, maybe you want\n    to send an alias or nick as part of your announce message rather than just\n    use the signaller's generated id.\n\n    If for instance you were writing a simple chat application you could join\n    the `webrtc` room and tell everyone your name with the following announce\n    call:\n\n    ```js\n    signaller.announce({\n      room: 'webrtc',\n      nick: 'Damon'\n    });\n    ```\n\n    #### Announcing Updates\n\n    The signaller is written to distinguish between initial peer announcements\n    and peer data updates (see the docs on the announce handler below). As\n    such it is ok to provide any data updates using the announce method also.\n\n    For instance, I could send a status update as an announce message to flag\n    that I am going offline:\n\n    ```js\n    signaller.announce({ status: 'offline' });\n    ```\n\n  **/\n  signaller.announce = function(data) {\n    announced = true;\n    signaller._update(data);\n    clearTimeout(announceTimer);\n\n    // send the attributes over the network\n    return announceTimer = setTimeout(signaller._announce, (opts || {}).announceDelay || 10);\n  };\n\n  /**\n    ### leave()\n\n    Tell the signalling server we are leaving.  Calling this function is\n    usually not required though as the signalling server should issue correct\n    `/leave` messages when it detects a disconnect event.\n\n  **/\n  signaller.leave = signaller.close = function() {\n    // send the leave signal\n    signaller.send('/leave', { id: signaller.id });\n\n    // stop announcing on reconnect\n    signaller.removeListener('disconnected', handleDisconnect);\n    signaller.removeListener('connected', signaller._announce);\n\n    // end our current queue\n    queue.end();\n\n    // set connected to false\n    readyState = RS_DISCONNECTED;\n  };\n\n  // update the signaller agent\n  signaller._update({ agent: 'signaller@' + metadata.version });\n\n  // autoconnect\n  if (autoconnect === undefined || autoconnect) {\n

For example, even if other promises given to the\n  `promises` array argument are resolved, but the first settled promise has\n  become rejected before the other promises became fulfilled, the returned\n  promise will become rejected:\n\n  ```javascript\n  let promise1 = new Promise(function(resolve, reject){\n    setTimeout(function(){\n      resolve('promise 1');\n    }, 200);\n  });\n\n  let promise2 = new Promise(function(resolve, reject){\n    setTimeout(function(){\n      reject(new Error('promise 2'));\n    }, 100);\n  });\n\n  Promise.race([promise1, promise2]).then(function(result){\n    // Code here never runs\n  }, function(reason){\n    // reason.message === 'promise 2' because promise 2 became rejected before\n    // promise 1 became fulfilled\n  });\n  ```\n\n  An example real-world use case is implementing timeouts:\n\n  ```javascript\n  Promise.race([ajax('foo.json'), timeout(5000)])\n  ```\n\n  @method race\n  @static\n  @param {Array} promises array of promises to observe\n  Useful for tooling.\n  @return {Promise} a promise which settles in the same way as the first passed\n  promise to settle.\n*/\nfunction race(entries) {\n  /*jshint validthis:true */\n  var Constructor = this;\n\n  if (!isArray(entries)) {\n    return new Constructor(function (_, reject) {\n      return reject(new TypeError('You must pass an array to race.'));\n    });\n  } else {\n    return new Constructor(function (resolve, reject) {\n      var length = entries.length;\n      for (var i = 0; i < length; i++) {\n        Constructor.resolve(entries[i]).then(resolve, reject);\n      }\n    });\n  }\n}\n\n/**\n  `Promise.reject` returns a promise rejected with the passed `reason`.\n  It is shorthand for the following:\n\n  ```javascript\n  let promise = new Promise(function(resolve, reject){\n    reject(new Error('WHOOPS'));\n  });\n\n  promise.then(function(value){\n    // Code here doesn't run because the promise is rejected!\n  }, function(reason){\n    // reason.message === 'WHOOPS'\n  });\n  ```\n\n  Instead of writing the above, your code now simply becomes the following:\n\n  ```javascript\n  let promise = Promise.reject(new Error('WHOOPS'));\n\n  promise.then(function(value){\n    // Code here doesn't run because the promise is rejected!\n  }, function(reason){\n    // reason.message === 'WHOOPS'\n  });\n  ```\n\n  @method reject\n  @static\n  @param {Any} reason value that the returned promise will be rejected with.\n  Useful for tooling.\n  @return {Promise} a promise rejected with the given `reason`.\n*/\nfunction reject(reason) {\n  /*jshint validthis:true */\n  var Constructor = this;\n  var promise = new Constructor(noop);\n  _reject(promise, reason);\n  return promise;\n}\n\nfunction needsResolver() {\n  throw new TypeError('You must pass a resolver function as the first argument to the promise constructor');\n}\n\nfunction needsNew() {\n  throw new TypeError(\"Failed to construct 'Promise': Please use the 'new' operator, this object constructor cannot be called as a function.\");\n}\n\n/**\n  Promise objects represent the eventual result of an asynchronous operation. The\n  primary way of interacting with a promise is through its `then` method, which\n  registers callbacks to receive either a promise's eventual value or the reason\n  why the promise cannot be fulfilled.\n\n  Terminology\n  -----------\n\n  - `promise` is an object or function with a `then` method whose behavior conforms to this specification.\n  - `thenable` is an object or function that defines a `then` method.\n  - `value` is any legal JavaScript value (including undefined, a thenable, or a promise).\n  - `exception` is a value that is thrown using the throw statement.\n  - `reason` is a value that indicates why a promise was rejected.\n  - `settled` the final resting state of a promise, fulfilled or rejected.\n\n  A promise can be in one of three states: pending, fulfilled, or rejected.\n\n  Promises that are fulfilled have a fulfillment value and are in the fulfilled\n  state.  Promises that are rejected have a rejection reason and are in the\n  rejected state.  A fulfillment value is never a thenable.\n\n  Promises can also be said to *resolve* a value.  If this value is also a\n  promise, then the original promise's settled state will match the value's\n  settled state.  So a promise that *resolves* a promise that rejects will\n  itself reject, and a promise that *resolves* a promise that fulfills will\n  itself fulfill.\n\n\n  Basic Usage:\n  ------------\n\n  ```js\n  let promise = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {\n    // on success\n    resolve(value);\n\n    // on failure\n    reject(reason);\n  });\n\n  promise.then(function(value) {\n    // on fulfillment\n  }, function(reason) {\n    // on rejection\n  });\n  ```\n\n  Advanced Usage:\n  ---------------\n\n  Promises shine when abstracting away asynchronous interactions such as\n  `XMLHttpRequest`s.\n\n  ```js\n  function getJSON(url) {\n    return new Promise(function(resolve, reject){\n      let xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();\n\n      xhr.open('GET', url);\n      xhr.onreadystatechange = handler;\n      xhr.responseType = 'json';\n      xhr.setRequestHeader('Accept', 'application/json');\n      xhr.send();\n\n      function handler() {\n        if (this.readyState === this.DONE) {\n          if (this.status === 200) {\n            resolve(this.response);\n          } else {\n            reject(new Error('getJSON: `' + url + '` failed with status: [' + this.status + ']'));\n          }\n        }\n      };\n    });\n  }\n\n  getJSON('/posts.json').then(function(json) {\n    // on fulfillment\n  }, function(reason) {\n    // on rejection\n  });\n  ```\n\n  Unlike callbacks, promises are great composable primitives.\n\n  ```js\n  Promise.all([\n    getJSON('/posts'),\n    getJSON('/comments')\n  ]).then(function(values){\n    values[0] // => postsJSON\n    values[1] // => commentsJSON\n\n    return values;\n  });\n  ```\n\n  @class Promise\n  @param {function} resolver\n  Useful for tooling.\n  @constructor\n*/\nfunction Promise(resolver) {\n  this[PROMISE_ID] = nextId();\n  this._result = this._state = undefined;\n  this._subscribers = [];\n\n  if (noop !== resolver) {\n    typeof resolver !== 'function' && needsResolver();\n    this instanceof Promise ? initializePromise(this, resolver) : needsNew();\n  }\n}\n\nPromise.all = all;\nPromise.race = race;\nPromise.resolve = resolve;\nPromise.reject = reject;\nPromise._setScheduler = setScheduler;\nPromise._setAsap = setAsap;\nPromise._asap = asap;\n\nPromise.prototype = {\n  constructor: Promise,\n\n  /**\n    The primary way of interacting with a promise is through its `then` method,\n    which registers callbacks to receive either a promise's eventual value or the\n    reason why the promise cannot be fulfilled.\n  \n    ```js\n    findUser().then(function(user){\n      // user is available\n    }, function(reason){\n      // user is unavailable, and you are given the reason why\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    Chaining\n    --------\n  \n    The return value of `then` is itself a promise.  This second, 'downstream'\n    promise is resolved with the return value of the first promise's fulfillment\n    or rejection handler, or rejected if the handler throws an exception.\n  \n    ```js\n    findUser().then(function (user) {\n      return user.name;\n    }, function (reason) {\n      return 'default name';\n    }).then(function (userName) {\n      // If `findUser` fulfilled, `userName` will be the user's name, otherwise it\n      // will be `'default name'`\n    });\n  \n    findUser().then(function (user) {\n      throw new Error('Found user, but still unhappy');\n    }, function (reason) {\n      throw new Error('`findUser` rejected and we're unhappy');\n    }).then(function (value) {\n      // never reached\n    }, function (reason) {\n      // if `findUser` fulfilled, `reason` will be 'Found user, but still unhappy'.\n      // If `findUser` rejected, `reason` will be '`findUser` rejected and we're unhappy'.\n    });\n    ```\n    If the downstream promise does not specify a rejection handler, rejection reasons will be propagated further downstream.\n  \n    ```js\n    findUser().then(function (user) {\n      throw new PedagogicalException('Upstream error');\n    }).then(function (value) {\n      // never reached\n    }).then(function (value) {\n      // never reached\n    }, function (reason) {\n      // The `PedgagocialException` is propagated all the way down to here\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    Assimilation\n    ------------\n  \n    Sometimes the value you want to propagate to a downstream promise can only be\n    retrieved asynchronously. This can be achieved by returning a promise in the\n    fulfillment or rejection handler. The downstream promise will then be pending\n    until the returned promise is settled. This is called *assimilation*.\n  \n    ```js\n    findUser().then(function (user) {\n      return findCommentsByAuthor(user);\n    }).then(function (comments) {\n      // The user's comments are now available\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    If the assimliated promise rejects, then the downstream promise will also reject.\n  \n    ```js\n    findUser().then(function (user) {\n      return findCommentsByAuthor(user);\n    }).then(function (comments) {\n      // If `findCommentsByAuthor` fulfills, we'll have the value here\n    }, function (reason) {\n      // If `findCommentsByAuthor` rejects, we'll have the reason here\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    Simple Example\n    --------------\n  \n    Synchronous Example\n  \n    ```javascript\n    let result;\n  \n    try {\n      result = findResult();\n      // success\n    } catch(reason) {\n      // failure\n    }\n    ```\n  \n    Errback Example\n  \n    ```js\n    findResult(function(result, err){\n      if (err) {\n        // failure\n      } else {\n        // success\n      }\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    Promise Example;\n  \n    ```javascript\n    findResult().then(function(result){\n      // success\n    }, function(reason){\n      // failure\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    Advanced Example\n    --------------\n  \n    Synchronous Example\n  \n    ```javascript\n    let author, books;\n  \n    try {\n      author = findAuthor();\n      books  = findBooksByAuthor(author);\n      // success\n    } catch(reason) {\n      // failure\n    }\n    ```\n  \n    Errback Example\n  \n    ```js\n  \n    function foundBooks(books) {\n  \n    }\n  \n    function failure(reason) {\n  \n    }\n  \n    findAuthor(function(author, err){\n      if (err) {\n        failure(err);\n        // failure\n      } else {\n        try {\n          findBoooksByAuthor(author, function(books, err) {\n            if (err) {\n              failure(err);\n            } else {\n              try {\n                foundBooks(books);\n              } catch(reason) {\n                failure(reason);\n              }\n            }\n          });\n        } catch(error) {\n          failure(err);\n        }\n        // success\n      }\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    Promise Example;\n  \n    ```javascript\n    findAuthor().\n      then(findBooksByAuthor).\n      then(function(books){\n        // found books\n    }).catch(function(reason){\n      // something went wrong\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    @method then\n    @param {Function} onFulfilled\n    @param {Function} onRejected\n    Useful for tooling.\n    @return {Promise}\n  */\n  then: then,\n\n  /**\n    `catch` is simply sugar for `then(undefined, onRejection)` which makes it the same\n    as the catch block of a try/catch statement.\n  \n    ```js\n    function findAuthor(){\n      throw new Error('couldn't find that author');\n    }\n  \n    // synchronous\n    try {\n      findAuthor();\n    } catch(reason) {\n      // something went wrong\n    }\n  \n    // async with promises\n    findAuthor().catch(function(reason){\n      // something went wrong\n    });\n    ```\n  \n    @method catch\n    @param {Function} onRejection\n    Useful for tooling.\n    @return {Promise}\n  */\n  'catch': function _catch(onRejection) {\n    return this.then(null, onRejection);\n  }\n};\n\nfunction polyfill() {\n    var local = undefined;\n\n    if (typeof global !== 'undefined') {\n        local = global;\n    } else if (typeof self !== 'undefined') {\n        local = self;\n    } else {\n        try {\n            local = Function('return this')();\n        } catch (e) {\n            throw new Error('polyfill failed because global object is unavailable in this environment');\n        }\n    }\n\n    var P = local.Promise;\n\n    if (P) {\n        var promiseToString = null;\n        try {\n            promiseToString = Object.prototype.toString.call(P.resolve());\n        } catch (e) {\n            // silently ignored\n        }\n\n        if (promiseToString === '[object Promise]' && !P.cast) {\n            return;\n        }\n    }\n\n    local.Promise = Promise;\n}\n\npolyfill();\n// Strange compat..\nPromise.polyfill = polyfill;\nPromise.Promise = Promise;\n\nreturn Promise;\n\n})));\n//# sourceMappingURL=es6-promise.map\n\n\n/*****************\n ** WEBPACK FOOTER\n ** ./~/es6-promise/dist/es6-promise.js\n ** module id = 156\n ** module chunks = 0\n **/","\"use strict\";\n\n/**\n * Copyright (c) 2013-present, Facebook, Inc.\n * All rights reserved.\n *\n * This source code is licensed under the BSD-style license found in the\n * LICENSE file in the root directory of this source tree.

By using this module you\n  are trading off some flexibility, so if you need a more flexible\n  configuration you should drill down into lower level components of the\n  [rtc.io](http://www.rtc.io) suite.  In particular you should check out\n  [rtc](https://github.com/rtc-io/rtc).\n\n  ## Example Usage\n\n  In the simplest case you simply call quickconnect with a single string\n  argument which tells quickconnect which server to use for signaling:\n\n  <<< examples/simple.js\n\n  <<< docs/events.md\n\n  <<< docs/examples.md\n\n  ## Regarding Signalling and a Signalling Server\n\n  Signaling is an important part of setting up a WebRTC connection and for\n  our examples we use our own test instance of the\n  [rtc-switchboard](https://github.com/rtc-io/rtc-switchboard). For your\n  testing and development you are more than welcome to use this also, but\n  just be aware that we use this for our testing so it may go up and down\n  a little.  If you need something more stable, why not consider deploying\n  an instance of the switchboard yourself - it's pretty easy :)\n\n  ## Reference\n\n  ```\n  quickconnect(signalhost, opts?) => rtc-sigaller instance (+ helpers)\n  ```\n\n  ### Valid Quick Connect Options\n\n  The options provided to the `rtc-quickconnect` module function influence the\n  behaviour of some of the underlying components used from the rtc.io suite.\n\n  Listed below are some of the commonly used options:\n\n  - `ns` (default: '')\n\n    An optional namespace for your signalling room.  While quickconnect\n    will generate a unique hash for the room, this can be made to be more\n    unique by providing a namespace.  Using a namespace means two demos\n    that have generated the same hash but use a different namespace will be\n    in different rooms.\n\n  - `room` (default: null) _added 0.6_\n\n    Rather than use the internal hash generation\n    (plus optional namespace) for room name generation, simply use this room\n    name instead.  __NOTE:__ Use of the `room` option takes precendence over\n    `ns`.\n\n  - `debug` (default: false)\n\n  Write rtc.io suite debug output to the browser console.\n\n  - `expectedLocalStreams` (default: not specified) _added 3.0_\n\n    By providing a positive integer value for this option will mean that\n    the created quickconnect instance will wait until the specified number of\n    streams have been added to the quickconnect \"template\" before announcing\n    to the signaling server.\n\n  - `manualJoin` (default: `false`)\n\n    Set this value to `true` if you would prefer to call the `join` function\n    to connecting to the signalling server, rather than having that happen\n    automatically as soon as quickconnect is ready to.\n\n  #### Options for Peer Connection Creation\n\n  Options that are passed onto the\n  [rtc.createConnection](https://github.com/rtc-io/rtc#createconnectionopts-constraints)\n  function:\n\n  - `iceServers`\n\n  This provides a list of ice servers that can be used to help negotiate a\n  connection between peers.\n\n  #### Options for P2P negotiation\n\n  Under the hood, quickconnect uses the\n  [rtc/couple](https://github.com/rtc-io/rtc#rtccouple) logic, and the options\n  passed to quickconnect are also passed onto this function.\n\n**/\nmodule.exports = function(signalhost, opts) {\n  var hash = typeof location != 'undefined' && location.hash.slice(1);\n  var signaller = require('rtc-pluggable-signaller')(extend({\n    signaller: signalhost,\n\n    // use the primus endpoint as a fallback in case we are talking to an\n    // older switchboard instance\n    endpoints: ['/', '/primus']\n  }, opts));\n\n  var getPeerData = require('./lib/getpeerdata')(signaller.peers);\n  var generateIceServers = require('rtc-core/genice');\n\n  // init configurable vars\n  var ns = (opts || {}).ns || '';\n  var room = (opts || {}).room;\n  var debugging = (opts || {}).debug;\n  var allowJoin = !(opts || {}).manualJoin;\n  var profile = {};\n  var announced = false;\n\n  // Schemes allow customisation about how connections are made\n  // In particular, providing schemes allows providing different sets of ICE servers\n  // between peers\n  var schemes = require('./lib/schemes')(signaller, opts);\n\n  // collect the local streams\n  var localStreams = [];\n\n  // create the calls map\n  var calls = signaller.calls = require('./lib/calls')(signaller, opts);\n\n  // create the known data channels registry\n  var channels = {};\n  var pending = {};\n  // Reconnecting indicates peers that are in the process of reconnecting\n  var reconnecting = {};\n\n  // save the plugins passed to the signaller\n  var plugins = signaller.plugins = (opts || {}).plugins || [];\n  var plugin = detectPlugin(plugins);\n  var pluginReady;\n\n  // check how many local streams have been expected (default: 0)\n  var expectedLocalStreams = parseInt((opts || {}).expectedLocalStreams, 10) || 0;\n  var announceTimer = 0;\n  var updateTimer = 0;\n\n  function checkReadyToAnnounce() {\n    clearTimeout(announceTimer);\n    // if we have already announced do nothing!\n    if (announced) {\n      return;\n    }\n\n    if (!

rtc-tools/couple\n\n  #### couple(pc, targetId, signaller, opts?)\n\n  Couple a WebRTC connection with another webrtc connection identified by\n  `targetId` via the signaller.\n\n  The following options can be provided in the `opts` argument:\n\n  - `sdpfilter` (default: null)\n\n    A simple function for filtering SDP as part of the peer\n    connection handshake (see the Using Filters details below).\n\n  ##### Example Usage\n\n  ```js\n  var couple = require('rtc/couple');\n\n  couple(pc, '54879965-ce43-426e-a8ef-09ac1e39a16d', signaller);\n  ```\n\n  ##### Using Filters\n\n  In certain instances you may wish to modify the raw SDP that is provided\n  by the `createOffer` and `createAnswer` calls.  This can be done by passing\n  a `sdpfilter` function (or array) in the options.  For example:\n\n  ```js\n  // run the sdp from through a local tweakSdp function.\n  couple(pc, '54879965-ce43-426e-a8ef-09ac1e39a16d', signaller, {\n    sdpfilter: tweakSdp\n  });\n  ```\n\n**/\nfunction couple(pc, targetId, signaller, opts) {\n  var debugLabel = (opts || {}).debugLabel || 'rtc';\n  var debug = require('cog/logger')(debugLabel + '/couple');\n\n  // create a monitor for the connection\n  var mon = monitor(pc, targetId, signaller, (opts || {}).logger);\n  var emit = mbus('', mon);\n  var reactive = (opts || {}).reactive;\n  var endOfCandidates = true;\n\n  // configure the time to wait between receiving a 'disconnect'\n  // iceConnectionState and determining that we are closed\n  var disconnectTimeout = (opts || {}).disconnectTimeout || 10000;\n  var disconnectTimer;\n\n  // Target ready indicates that the target peer has indicated it is\n  // ready to begin coupling\n  var targetReady = false;\n  var targetInfo = undefined;\n  var readyInterval = (opts || {}).readyInterval || 100;\n  var readyTimer;\n\n  // Failure timeout\n  var failTimeout = (opts || {}).failTimeout || 30000;\n  var failTimer;\n\n  // Request offer timer\n  var requestOfferTimer;\n\n  // Interoperability flags\n  var allowReactiveInterop = (opts || {}).allowReactiveInterop;\n\n  // initilaise the negotiation helpers\n  var isMaster = signaller.isMaster(targetId);\n\n  // initialise the processing queue (one at a time please)\n  var q = queue(pc, opts);\n  var coupling = false;\n  var negotiationRequired = false;\n  var renegotiateRequired = false;\n  var creatingOffer = false;\n  var interoperating = false;\n\n  /**\n    Indicates whether this peer connection is in a state where it is able to have new offers created\n   **/\n  function isReadyForOffer() {\n    return !coupling && pc.signalingState === 'stable';\n  }\n\n  function createOffer() {\n    // If coupling is already in progress, return\n    if (!isReadyForOffer()) return;\n\n    debug('[' + signaller.id + '] ' + 'Creating new offer for connection to ' + targetId);\n    // Otherwise, create the offer\n    coupling = true;\n    creatingOffer = true;\n    negotiationRequired = false;\n    q.createOffer().then(function() {\n      creatingOffer = false;\n    }).catch(function() {\n      creatingOffer = false;\n    });\n  }\n\n  var createOrRequestOffer = throttle(function() {\n    if (!targetReady) {\n      debug('[' + signaller.id + '] ' + targetId + ' not yet ready for offer');\n      return emit.once('target.ready', createOrRequestOffer);\n    }\n\n    // If this is not the master, always send the negotiate request\n    // Redundant requests are eliminated on the master side\n    if (! isMaster) {\n      debug('[' + signaller.id + '] ' + 'Requesting negotiation from ' + targetId + ' (requesting offerer?

Sometimes it's called a \"filter\",\n// but that's not a great name for it, since that implies a thing where\n// some bits pass through, and others are simply ignored.  (That would\n// be a valid example of a transform, of course.)\n//\n// While the output is causally related to the input, it's not a\n// necessarily symmetric or synchronous transformation.  For example,\n// a zlib stream might take multiple plain-text writes(), and then\n// emit a single compressed chunk some time in the future.\n//\n// Here's how this works:\n//\n// The Transform stream has all the aspects of the readable and writable\n// stream classes.  When you write(chunk), that calls _write(chunk,cb)\n// internally, and returns false if there's a lot of pending writes\n// buffered up.  When you call read(), that calls _read(n) until\n// there's enough pending readable data buffered up.\n//\n// In a transform stream, the written data is placed in a buffer.  When\n// _read(n) is called, it transforms the queued up data, calling the\n// buffered _write cb's as it consumes chunks.  If consuming a single\n// written chunk would result in multiple output chunks, then the first\n// outputted bit calls the readcb, and subsequent chunks just go into\n// the read buffer, and will cause it to emit 'readable' if necessary.\n//\n// This way, back-pressure is actually determined by the reading side,\n// since _read has to be called to start processing a new chunk.  However,\n// a pathological inflate type of transform can cause excessive buffering\n// here.  For example, imagine a stream where every byte of input is\n// interpreted as an integer from 0-255, and then results in that many\n// bytes of output.  Writing the 4 bytes {ff,ff,ff,ff} would result in\n// 1kb of data being output.  In this case, you could write a very small\n// amount of input, and end up with a very large amount of output.  In\n// such a pathological inflating mechanism, there'd be no way to tell\n// the system to stop doing the transform.
